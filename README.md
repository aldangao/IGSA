# IGSA
code of "IGSA: An Information-Guided Synchronized Attack Framework for High-Transferability Multimodal Attack"

Currently, I release some of the code for this paper. Once the paper is accepted, I will release all the code.

The “IGSA_attacker” contains a portion of the attack framework code for IGSA;

The “critic_objectives” contains the relevant code for the mutual information estimator we have constructed.

The implementation details will be released later.
